    "\n",
    "- starting first from a simple implementation where spin variables are represented by a signed integer (```int```), \n",
    "- then shifting to using unsigned chars (```unsigned char```), and \n",
    "- finally land on an asynchronous-multi-spin-coded (aMSC) implementation where the spin variables will be stored in the bits of unsigned integers (```unsigned int``` or ```unsigned``` according to the architecture) and will be updated in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last step allows for roughly a 32-fold factor gain in performance with respect to the simples signed integer representation since we will be simulating 32 systems in paraller. This is done at the cost of introducing a small correlation between different realizations of the system. At the same time, this process will allow to have a faster convergence of the statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process we will shift strategy for the memory addressing going from a straightforward geometrical implementation which will then evolve to a checkerboard separation and finally end in a **sliced** scheme which allows for a better alignement of the memory reads while halving the number of MPI memory transfers in the multi-process implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be measuring the performance differences with the built-in tools of the **idea.deploy** framework and also develop some standard statistical analysis tools along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is clearly *physics-oriented* and serves the double purpose of illustrating the functionalities of the framework while being *educational* as far as the two-dimensional Ising model and simple statistical analysis are concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be constantly pushing updates on the *develop* branch of this project so that the last version can simply be retreived by constantly pulling the modifications to the repository.\n",
