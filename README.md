# Welcome to the idea.deploy project!

Thanks for passing by! If you are visiting this repository it is likely because of the DSFD 2020 presentation I have given on July the 16th. As a first step I will posting here the code and the content of the paper about the higher order isotropy of the lattice pressure tensor for the Shan-Chen multi-phase model. This will be available in a jupyter notebook format that will allow to reproduce the various results while displaying the content of the paper itself.

However, this is only the first step.

The repository is at an early stage in this moment and will keep evolving (hopefully for the best!) as time passes. The main spirit is to make public what has been used to obtain the numerical results published both on the public archive arxiv.org and on peer-reviewed journals. The software and the other contents will be steadily updated, so that the main criteria is not to provide the "definitive" code version but the code version that actually made the published results possible. As the code-base grows and evolves backwards compatibility will be assured.

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of the idea.deploy project can be described in three points
- To provide a unified open-source environment for scientific code for physics simulations
- To assure the reproducibility of published numerical results (one of the fundamental features of the scientific method)
- Acknowledgement of contributions
